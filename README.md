# PS-Reusable-Code-Assets


## What is PS Reusable Code Assets?

This repo gives Confluent's Professional Reusable Code Assets a central github repository that has the README and links to all the code assets that have successfully gone through the PS Reusable Assets Review cycle. 

## How do we organize the code assets?

We have a folder for each product category that we use for our PS Reusable Assets. We place the README of each code asset in its appropriate product folder but rename the markdown file to the name of the code application. In each markdown file, the title is a hyperlink that goes to straight to the project's source code. This allows us to have a central location for Professional Services reviewed code assets without managing the software development lifecycle of each open-source project.


Create a PR against adds the open-source's README file to appropriate product directory. Make sure the README is renamed to the title of the open-source application. Below is an example:

```
disaster_recovery/disaster_recovery_playground.md
```


##  Why not organize all the open-source code into this project?

Frankly, managing all the open-source projects in one repository is a large effort that can be quite costly in terms of time. We still want the asset authors to own their projects without interfering with the code review cycle. This serves as one stop shop directory for all code assets that were developed and submitted through the PS Reusable Asset Review process.
